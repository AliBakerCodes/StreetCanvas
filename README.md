## Description 
Street Canvas is an augmented reality-based app that brings some excitement to everyday life by allowing users to unleash their creativity onto the world!  Upload and pin an image/3d Model, or search along the map for other pins to discover --- and see what they look like once you're in its location!


## Usage
To access the features, one must creat an account.  Upon logging in, a person can upload their own images, and pin them to a location. Then they are able to see that image rendered live via Augmented reality.  <br/>
The user can also explore the map and search for other pegged images other users have placed within their radius.
